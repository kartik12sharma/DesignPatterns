<h3>
    Flywieght pattern is mainly used in frontend applications but can also be seen in backend apps. 
    <br>
    It is used when we have to process(display as far as frontend is concerned) or store large number of object which would if traditionally processed cost a significant chunk of memory and compute power.
    <br>
    The problem is divided into two states -
    <br>
    <ol>
    <li>intrinsic</li>
    <li>extrinsic</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <u><bold>Intrinsic</bold></u>
    <br>
    It stores the attributes which are constant and do not change throughout the execution.
    <br>
    <br>
    <u><bold>Extrinsic</bold></u>
    It stores the attributes that change over time or are dynamic in nature. The extrinsic state has reference of intrinsic state to fetch the info which is constant among objects.
