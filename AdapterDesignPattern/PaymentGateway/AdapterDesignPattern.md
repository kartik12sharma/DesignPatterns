<centre><h3>Adapter design pattern is used to integrate incompatible objects like interfaces, classes etc.</h3></centre>

<centre><h3>
Parameters can change overtime for incompatible interfaces, therefore instead of sending a series of parametres as is to adapter class, we use what is called a 'dto' which is data-transfer object which in simple words is a class defined with needed parameters as its field. Therefore, the object of such a class is sent with all the necessary info instead of a series of paramteres being sent as is.
